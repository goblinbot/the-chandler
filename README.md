# The Chandler

A Secret Histories themed discord bot, inspired by the many, many tarot/aura RNG bots out there.

Primarily built using discord.js.

## Why?

Because this way I can automate my daily dosage of yelling Cultist Simulator / Book of Hours / Secret Histories LORE and GENERAL TIDBITS at my friends.

Additionally, just me wanting to learn how to make a proper Discord bot with 2025 tools.
